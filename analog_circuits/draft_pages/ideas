*** An EE student's apology: misconceptions and issues in EE education

current flow and charge flow: which is correct? (charge flow, but for some reason we still say current flow)
- why? see issue on electron flow vs conventional current flow, stackexchange

op-amps
- really just voltage amplifiers. can sub in ideal equivalent circuit model and solve that way

bjts
- really just current amplifiers. can sub in ideal equivalent circuit model for this, too

mosfets
- really just current sources. Gate current is always assumed to be zero.
- provide solution for V_GS in terms of I_D (WHY is this not in Sedra and Smith?)

diodes
- typically have 0.7 V dropped across them. Essentially act like voltage sources to the rest of the circuit, in most cases

kvl & kcl
- see document from F2019. Might need to change examples so we don't have homework-solution-sharing issues

approaches to circuit analysis: what are you actually trying to do?
- figure out what variables you're given and what ones you need to find
-- given either voltage or current, push through this topology to find the other. (given voltage, find current. given current, find voltage)
-- general case of Ohm's law: V = ZI. Use s parameters for general DC/AC case, and make that part clear.
- shortcuts
-- nodal analysis: all resistor paths to ground from a single node can be written in parallel, on sight. See Vorperian prob. 3.9.
-- can apply superposition using dependent sources. Caveat: have to wait to calculate values until full algebraic solution is reached.

We should have manipulation rules for working with parallel operators.

*** annotated bibliography of advice and other resources I found useful (mostly books)
- See end of the resourcepage.org file for a start: also check *.bib for anything I didn't include yet.
