* File structure
~ideas~: where all the plans go. This is the main document I'm working from.

~resourcepage.org~: The monolithic file I'm using to produce this page via Emacs' Org Mode. This has all the actual information in it.
~resourcepage.html~: Neat browser view of the same file.

I don't know where the *.raw and *.log files came from. I'm assuming they're from Org Mode's html export process.

Everything else is either an image or MathJax render files.
