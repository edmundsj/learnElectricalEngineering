  abstract = {Many introductory circuits texts state or imply that superposition of dependent sources cannot be used in linear circuit analysis. Although the use of superposition of only independent sources leads to the correct solution, it does not make use of the full power of superposition. The use of superposition of dependent sources often leads to a simpler solution than other techniques of circuit analysis. A formal proof is presented that superposition of dependent sources is valid provided the controlling variable is not set to zero when the source is deactivated. Several examples are given which illustrate the technique.},
